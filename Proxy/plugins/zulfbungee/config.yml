# - Key Setup -

# This chooses what communication method ZulfBungee uses.
# pluginmessage requires no setup, but requires you to enter a connection name (see below).
# socket requires more setup but allows for more flexible setups.
# Generally, if you don't know what this means, leave it as pluginmessage.
transport-type: "pluginmessage"

# This will toggle the display of detailed messages about what is going to the console.
# When filing a bug report / checking for issues, this is extremely useful to know what exactly went wrong!
debug: false

# Enables or disables global scripts.
global-scripts: true

# - Socket Setup -

# This is the port that this server will bind to, which will it listen for incoming connections on.
port: 8000

# The IP that this server will bind to. Similar to the "client-host" in the Spigot config.
# This should usually be left as 0.0.0.0, or 127.0.0.1, but feel free to change this if you need to -
# (i.e. you are on shared hosting / Pterodactyl)
host: "0.0.0.0"


# - Storage -

# What kind of database should be used to store network variables.
# Currently, supported databases: MySQL, H2

# If you have no clue what this does, just leave this as the default.
storage-type: "h2"

# Skript by default is case-insensitive for variable names.
# If you want this functionality, enable it here.
case-insensitive-variables: false

# Each option should be self-explanatory if you know what you are doing.

# If you are using H2, this will not apply - these two settings only apply to remote databases like MySQL.
storage-host: "localhost"
storage-port: 3306

# !! Change these from the default to improve security !!
storage-username: "username"
storage-password: "password"

storage-database: "database"

# - MySQL Setup -

# If you get errors in console because of SSL, disable it here, but it's better to set up SSL on the MySQL server.
